## Documentation
**cookiecutter.json** explained in-depth. See [cookiecutter.json](cookiecutter.json) for default values.

Prompt | Explanation
--- | ---
`author_name` | Your full name, including first and last names, titles, and possibly even your middle name. This will go under *Project Lead* in **AUTHORS.md**.
`author_email` | The email address you want associated with the repository. This will go under *Project Lead* in **AUTHORS.md**.
`git_username` | Your local git and `remote_provider` (see below) account username. This will be used for all git-based actions.
`repository_namespace` | The namespace where the repository will live, which can be a user or organization, group, or team (depending on the `remote_provider`). This will only be used if `create_remote` (see below) is `yes`.
`repository_slug` | The repository name which should only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes. This will be the local, top-level directory name, the remote endpoint, and the *H1* in the **README.md**.
`repository_description` | A short description about the repository. This will be the remote description setting, and the content under the *H1* in the **README.md**.
`package_name` | The child directory name. This will be dependent on your codebase. For example, the default value contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores suitable for [python development](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
`create_remote` | A `yes` or `no` choice on whether or not a remote repository is automatically created for you. This option is the main reason for *cookiecutter-git*, so the default choice is `yes`.
`remote_provider` | A choice between the three main, git, remote repository providers. This will only be used if `create_remote` is `yes`, and defaults to `github.com`.
`gitignore` | A comma-separated values list of preset templates of files for git to ignore. See the [gitignore.io docs](https://github.com/joeblau/gitignore.io#list) for a complete list of available values. This will be used to generate the **.gitignore** file.
`license` | The software license for the repository. This will be used to generate the **LICENSE** and **NOTICE** files, and determines how end users can ultimately use your source code.
`copyright_holder` | The individual or company that holds the intellectual property copyright. This will be used in the **LICENSE** file, rather than the `author_name`.
